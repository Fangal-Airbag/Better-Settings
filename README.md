# Better Settings
An aroma plugin that improves the System Settings user experience by adding support for viewing important info on the TV and adds input support for Wii U Pro Controllers and Wii Classic Controllers! Sadly does not work if you do not have a Gamepad powered on and paired with your system at the moment... (It's planned though!)

## Building

To build this make sure you have [wut](https://github.com/devkitPro/wut) and [wups](https://github.com/wiiu-env/WiiUPluginSystem) installed. Then just run `make` in the same directory as the Makefile and place the resulting `.wps` in `sd:/wiiu/envioronments/aroma/plugins`.
