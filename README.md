# Better Settings
An aroma plugin that improves the System Settings user experience by adding support for viewing important info on the TV, and adding input support for Wii U Pro Controllers and Wii Classic Controllers!

## Building
To build this make sure you have [wut](https://github.com/devkitPro/wut) and [wups](https://github.com/wiiu-env/WiiUPluginSystem) installed. Then just run `make` in the same directory as the Makefile and place the resulting `.wps` in `sd:/wiiu/envioronments/aroma/plugins`.
